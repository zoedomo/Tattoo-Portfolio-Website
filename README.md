# Zoe Ann Chase | Tattoo Portfolio Website 🎨🖤

This is a responsive web portfolio I built for my professional tattoo work, combining front-end development, accessibility, and a Y2K-inspired grunge design aesthetic. 
The site showcases flash, portfolio work, studio info, booking, and event updates — all built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
