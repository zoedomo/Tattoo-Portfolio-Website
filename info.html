    <p>Taking care of your new tattoo is crucial for proper healing and long-lasting results. Here's how to care for your ink:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
      <li> Wash your hands before touching your tattoo.</li>
      <li> Gently clean your tattoo with lukewarm water and mild, fragrance-free soap.</li>
      <li> Pat dry with a clean paper towel — don't rub.</li>
      <li> Let your tattoo breathe for a few minutes, then apply a thin layer of recommended aftercare ointment.</li>
      <li> Wear loose, clean clothing over the area — avoid tight or abrasive fabrics.</li>
      <li> Avoid direct sunlight, swimming, and soaking your tattoo until it's fully healed (about 2-4 weeks).</li>
      <li> Do not pick, scratch, or peel the scabs or flakes!</li>
      <li> Contact me if you have any questions or concerns during healing!</li>

      <p>"It was great to see Zoey do our matching biohazard tattoos, and she did an incredible job. This artist is absolutely amazing with great line work and the sweetest disposition in the world. She is definitely worth checking out. The shop itself is incredible with a fun vibe and inviting atmosphere. Everyone will make you feel incredibly welcome and the owner, Kari, lets everyone know she’s always down to have them come up and hang out. 
        It’s just a totally different atmosphere in the best way possible from any other piercing and tattoo establishment."</p>
